# Heart-Failure-Prediction-and-analysis
Here, the objective is to build a model to predict if a patient has potentially a heart disease or not based on his or her previous medical records. This model uses a dataset containing the medical records of 918 patients with ages ranging from 30 to 70 years old. The graphical representation and visualization of data using matplotlib and seaborn library help to easily understand the data. This also gives a better understanding of the relationship between the different features, correlations, and outliers. This notebook includes the exploratory data analysis, logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest implementation.
